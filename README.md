## World Tour 2018 Theatre Demos

This repository holds all demos for the World Tour theatre presentations (if a presentation has a demo part). This allows us to easily distribute and scale the content across the possible speakers.

After the initial set up we'll move the content to a public accessible GitHub repo (tbd).

## How-To

1. Create for the presentation demo a sub folder here that reflects the presentation (for easier association).
1. Everything Salesforce should be a Salesforce DX project.
1. Detail in the README.md of the sub folder the needed set up steps - or even better: provide a set up script if it makes sense. More automation makes it easier for anybody.

## Commit rules

We use pull requests - seriously. ;-)
